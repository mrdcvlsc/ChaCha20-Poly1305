## ChaCha20 & Poly1305

this is a C++ implementation of ```ChaCha20 & Poly1305``` stream cipher described in [RFC - 8439](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8439).

All information and content in this _readme.md_'s **Dev Notes** section about ```ChaCha20 & Poly1305``` came from or a pharaphrase of a certain sentence/paragraph/section in [RFC - 8439](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8439)... except those bullets that has a **[dsi]** tag at the start which are _(me)developer's self interpretation_.

The [dsi] bullet points might possiblly be an inaccurate or incorrect description.

## Dev Notes
- **ChaCha state** - The description of the ChaCha algorithm will at various time refer to the **ChaCha state** as a **"vector"** of 16 elements represented as a 4x4 **"matrix"**. The matrix notation is more _visually convenient_ and gives a better notion as to _why some rounds_ are called **"column rounds"** while others are called **"diagonal rounds"**.

```
0 1 2 3
4 5 6 7
8 9 10 11
12 13 14 15
```

- **ChaCha** - is the algorithm name

- **ChaCha20** - is a specific instance of ChaCha where **20 rounds** (or **80 quarter rounds**) are used.

- **ChaCha Quarter Round** - This is the basic operation of the algorithm. The "ChaCha Quarter Round" operates on four 32-bit ```unsigned int```; a, b, c & d.

- **[dsi] The bit left  roll operator (```<<<```)**
    ```c++
    // for little endian only
    unsigned int bit_left_roll(unsigned int num, size_t n)
    {
        unsigned int msb = (num << n);
        unsigned int lsb = (num >> 32-n);
        return msb | lsb;
    }
    ```

- **A Quarter Round on the ChaCha State** - The chacha works only on 4 of different index of the ChaCha state per quarter round ex: ```QUARTERROUND(1, 5, 9, 13)``` (Note that this run of quarter round is part of what is called a
 "column round".)
    ```
     0 *a  2  3
     4 *b  6  7
     8 *c 10 11
    12 *d 14 15
    ```

- **The ChaCha20 Block Function** - This function transforms a ChaCha state by running multiple quarter rounds

- **The inputs to ChaCha20 Block Function are:**
    - A 256-bit key, treated as a concatenation of eight 32-bit little-endian integers.
    - A 96-bit nonce, treated as a concatenation of three 32-bit little-endian integers.
    - A 32-bit block count parameter, treated as a 32-bit little-endian integer.

- **The output ChaCha20 Block is a 64 random-looking bytes.**

- **The ChaCha of RFC-8439**

    - The ChaCha algorithm described [here/RFC - 8439](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8439) uses a **256-bit key**.

    - The _original algorithm_ also specified **128-bit** keys and an **8** and **12-round variants**, but these are out of scope for this [document/RFC - 8439](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8439).

    - Note also that the original ChaCha had a 64-bit nonce and 64-bit block count. We have modified this here to be more consistent with recommendations in Section 3.2 of [RFC5116]. This limits the use of a single (key,nonce) combination to 2^32 blocks, or 256 GB, but that is enough for most uses. In cases where a single key is used by multiple senders, it is important to make sure that they donâ€™t use the same nonces. This can be assured by partitioning the nonce space so that the first 32 bits are unique per sender, while the other 64 bits come from a counter.

- **The ChaCha20 state is initialized as follows:**

    - The first four words (0-3) are constants: ```0x61707865```, ```0x3320646e```, ```0x79622d32```, ```0x6b206574```.

    - The next eight words (4-11) are taken from the **256-bit key** by reading the bytes in little-endian order, in 4-byte chunks.

    - Word 12 is a block counter. Since each block is 64-byte, a 32-bit word is enough for 256 gigabytes of data.

    - Words 13-15 are a nonce, which MUST not be repeated for the same key. The 13th word is the first 32 bits of the input nonce taken as a little-endian integer, while the 15th word is the last 32 bits.
